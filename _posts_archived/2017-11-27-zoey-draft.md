#### Zoey is drafting

My daughter is about to turn seven. She has been steadily progressing at magic over the past two months. My wife and I wated to introduce her to magic until she could read with some comprehension of the cards. It was a good idea.

Before magic, Zoey loved playing drafting games like Sushi Go and Seven Wonders. Still, it surprised me just how quickly she understood the concept of drafting a card pool. Her first games of magic were a dive into the deep end with the Commander 2017 release. She would team up with Carin as the vampires against daddy's Wizards, Dragons or Cats. Soon, she took over the dragon deck herself, winning her first three-person game (First four turns: "this is boring". Last turn: "Cast dragon creature, cascade into other dragon, all my dragons have haste and do damage when ETB, alpha strike parents for win").

Next, she build a couple of constructed decks. One Eldrazi Tron and one stoneforge blade. She had fun learning how to sequence tron lands and what to search up with <span showcard all-formats>Stoneforge Mystic</span>. Anything that could get a planeswalker on the table would be a sweet play for her. Especially with <span showcard="Karn Liberated">Karn</span>.

She opened her first planeswalker during a 3-person draft at home. <span showcard>Huatli, Warrior Poet</span>. Her quote was "You always remember when you open your first planeswalker". A few days later, I picked up some sale packs of Born of the Gods and she opened a <span showcard>Kiora, the Crashing Wave</span> - right after I told her how rare it is to open a walker.

Last night, we had a 2-person winston draft with Ixalan. Bedtime was fast approaching when we started our first game. I planned on crushing her, as I usually play really easy. She completely hosed me at every turn with total jank. After killing my initial aggro flying wave, she dropped <span showcard>Axis of Mortality</span> to stabilize back to 20 life with me now at 5. No worries, I can try out a quick <span showcard>Revel in Riches</span> alt-win since I have a <span showcard>Ruthless Knave</span> out, several creatures, and a <span showcard="Grim Captain">Grim Captain's Call</span> to recur the treasure producing ability on the Knave.

Sadly, she had enchantment removal and killed my riches plan. Well played, Zoey. Time to up the difficulty level.
