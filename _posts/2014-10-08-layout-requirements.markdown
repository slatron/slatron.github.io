In my last post, I mention a "toolbox" area of the page without defining it. Let's do that now, especially since this should be a short post and it's family movie night tonight (Lego Movie, fourth viewing, Zoey's pick).

There should be two main areas of the application interface: A "Toolbox" and a "Pattern Grid". The Toolbox will contain the color picker as well as a form to enter new colors. There should also be a menu to save the current Pattern Grid state or load in a new one.

There should also be some basic drawing tools:

- a "Pencil" tool to fill in grid squares with the selected color
- an "Eraser" tool to remove the color from that position in the Pattern Grid

The Pencil should also overwrite the current grid square color with the current selected color.

THe Toolbox will likely be in a collapsible sidebar on the page. The Pattern Grid will take up the rest of the page, or all of it if the Toolbox is collapsed.

Well, that was pretty short. Guess I'll be able to concentrate on the Movie with Zoey and Carin tonight after all. Yay for laptop on the CTA!
