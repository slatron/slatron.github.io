### For The Boys

As a change, I arranged Rockville as a Mad Bread song. We can cover bass, guitar, mandolin, fiddle and banjo. There are four of us in the band, so  no more than that at once.

I've gone over the chords with them at the last couple rehearsals. I've done this with a couple others, but this one is folk-adjacent enough to fit better.

### Final Mix

This one didn't get much of a mix. Instead of a close civer, I went for rough demo. It fits more to leave it like this and let it evolve if hte band picks it up. So this one should be kind of an outlier here. Though I'll probably to more arrangements like this. REM or post-REM project.

Six songs left to go. Two slow, four burners.

### Final Tracks (7)
- Vocals (3)
- Guitar
- Bass
- Piano
- Fiddle

### Learnings

- I need to re-shed fiddle before performing or recording
