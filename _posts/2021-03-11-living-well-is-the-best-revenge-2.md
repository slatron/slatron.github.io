### Calling
This was another quick song to come together. I spent the first three days this week practiving the main riff on acounstic and electric. I almost went with a fingerpicked electric part for the recording. I'm much more accurate with the notes, but this really needs that pick attack.

I took the main rhythm guitar part and spread it across two tracks panned left and right. I used an alternate take as an effects track. There's a high pass filter and a slow flanger on it. It's up in the mix whenever the vocals are gone.

The vocals were supposed to be a quick scratch take. But I liked them so much, I decided to leave them alone as is. Kinda like how the original was recorded. Except I'm not Michael 8 ). Backgrounds were similarly one in done - well, two in done as there's one for each ear.

### Final Tracks (15)

### Faithful Cover?
Somewhat. I substituted the effects track in for the organ. I also played the guitar part sloppy enough on the verses to make it not faithful.

### Learnings
- I've learned how to control my breath and support myself at lot better on these loud vocals
- Driving bass is a great workout
