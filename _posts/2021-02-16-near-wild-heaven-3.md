### Wild Heaven Vocals
I've always agreed with the sentiment that Mike's background vocals are REMs secret weapon. I don't think he could have been more of a lead singer. Singing his parts here was very easy compared to Michael's. I've always felt sympathetic to Mike, and this is one more reason to support that. I've always been a strong backup singer but never a great lead.

I'm mostly surprised by Bill's performance on the "Living Inside" parts. Those are so solid, despite clearly being in falsetto.

I have ten vocal tracks tonight. It still sounds sparse in some areas. I'll double the harmonies that only have one track. There's also a response on some of the "Near Wild Heaven" chorus lines. My plan is to listen against the original recording and add vocal parts as I go. 27 might not be too far off a guess.
