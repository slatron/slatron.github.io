### Babylon 5

For podcast research purposes, I've been watching Babylon 5. The mid-90's sci-fi Television series. The one that wasn't Star Trek and made Tron a starship captain.

I watched some of it in its original run during the 4-5 season. My college friend Karl was deep into the show. He would have viewing parties every week as new episodes came out. I experienced the first three seasons vicariously through printouts Karl made from [the Lurker's Guide](http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/lurker.html). I vaguely remember the episodes I did catch.

It was in the early days of the internets. Bab 5 was one of the first TV shows to truly get a boost from interacting with fans on the internet. Series overlord J. Michael Strazinski(JMS) would interact with fans over message groups as early as 1991. Many are archived [here](http://www.jmsnews.com/messages/archive).

### Series as Visual Novel

JMS wanted to use TV to tell a long-running but complete story. Like a novel with each episode acting as a chapter in the overall story. This hadn't been done to this extent on American Television. Hill Street Blues had done arcs that lasted throughout each season. But Babylon 5 was conceived as a single story.

One of the problems with this approach is how to keep the audience invested through the early shows before any plot or characters are established. Babylon 5 is a political drama that spans races, each with their own motives and weaknesses. A story like this takes immense amounts of world building to get the plot off the ground.

JMS had to keep plots coming to satisfy episodic tv demands, but needed to also lay ground for future stories. A device was needed to quickly escalate stakes before establishing much about character.

Enter the Babylon 5 Sucka Punch!

### Sucka Punch!

To get to quick conflict, JMS heavily relied on one character knocking the shit out of another from nowhere an average of once per episode. I started cataloging these and referring to them as the "Babylon 5 Sucka Punch".

#### Definition of “SUCKA PUNCH”

```
Terminology:
 Sucka: Target of Punch
 Puncha: Puncher
 Viewa: Audience

1. Must come out of nowhere as a surprise
 a. Sucka surprise is most common
 b. Puncha is rarely surprised
 c. Viewa is usually also surprised
    i. Viewa can be “in on the punch” before it happens
    ii. Viewa can be in-show or meta
2. Must connect hit with Sucka
 a. A failed Sucka Punch is pathetic and should be mocked
3. Is not necessarily from a fist
 a. ex… a kick is just a Sucka Punch from the foot
 b. Lazers and knives are also forms of punching
 c. Guns disqualify the Sucka Punch
```

### Babylon 5 Season 1 Sucka Punches By Episode

Following is a description of every scene in B5 season 1 that includes a Sucka Punch. The punches are certainly clustered towards the beginning of the series. Some in the middle feature as many as three Sucka Punches. Considering there are twenty recorded punches and twenty-two episodes - things taper off considerably in the back half.

All scene descriptions paraphrased for humor from episode synopsis on [Midwinter.com](http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/countries/us/eplist.html)

#### Episode 2 Soul Hunter

Right after Delenn leaves the Med Lab, Soul Hunter feigns injury and falls to the floor. The guard who was stationed outside the Med Lab rushes in, but is victimizeds by a Sucka Punch. Soul Hunter escapes gun in hand, with renewed sense of purpose.

Franklin believes that Sinclair may have been given large doses of psychotropic drugs and may consequently be delusional or even dangerous. As he disconnects from the machine, the feedback knocks out Knight Two.

Knight One storms into the room, but Sinclair punches him, knocking him out. He picks up a gun and escapes from the room. He is delusional, he mumbles to himself about how the Minbari have broken through and how he must get back to his ship.

#### Episode 9 - Deathwalker

Na'Toth, who is waiting at the docking bay for a ship to arrive, suddenly notices a certain woman come on board B5. Na'Toth is suddenly seized with rage and runs across the room, shouting, "Deathwalker." Na'Toth executes a sloppy but effective full-body lunge attack on the visitor.

Dre Alvarez says this is a Sucka Punch. I call shenanigans on the house of Alvarez. Any attack announced that brazenly cannot be categorized as a Sucka Punch.

Garibaldi, upon returning to his quarters, is confronted by a security officer. Major Kemmer and Lieutenant Cutter arrive, and Garibaldi pleads with Kemmer to allow him to speak with her.

</div>

Garibaldi narrowly escapes Kemmer's guards and eventually returns to the human sector of B5, only to be attacked by a group of angry aliens. Just when it appears that Garibaldi has no hope left, Sinclair - who has a deep thirst for punching Suckas - finds him and helps to fight off the aliens.

Kemmer tells Cutter that she wants to scan the bay herself, but Cutter knocks her out. He points a gun at Garibaldi, but when he bends down to recover Kemmer's weapon, Garibaldi kicks the gun out of his hand. A struggle ensues, but Garibaldi gains the upper hand by landing a surprise sucka hero landing pose on Cutter, completely crushing the heathen's spine.

In the corridor, an alien named Caliban tells Smith that there is another way to get into the Mutai. "But it will require respect, and great courage." Smith is very interested. Then a surly muppet shows up out of nowhere and pops Smith in his stupid mouth.

Two thugs try to capture Jinxo, but Gajic fights them off. Gajix is a Sucka Punch monk and is able to pull off an S tier behind the back SP with his stick. Mid-fight Sucka Punches are rare, but the fight to this point was all misdirection by these hands away from the surprise stick finish.

### Final Thoughts

All this is to say I've had a fascinating experience cataloging all the Sucka Punches in the first season of Babylon 5. I'm three seasons in as I write this post and it definitely shifts to more "space opera" and less "space smugglers hitting each other with sticks".

Season one of B5 feels pretty trashy compared to later seasons. More of a Dr. Who cheap BBC set vibe than TNG quality. But that quality sings with a well placed Sucka Punch to manufacture cheap plot momentum.

While we would eventually lose the frequent punch, we get deeper connections between the characters. After spending multiple seasons with G'Kar, you understand him as more of a sympathetic character and less of a buffoon. Same with Londo, but in a completely different way. The plot drivers can become much more subtle than Sucka Punches when you are invested.

Looking forward to releasing so many more of my thoughts on B5 with the podcast coming out soon. We recorded an episode discussing the B5 Sucka Punch that will either be the pilot or bonus content. Look out for the "You Gotta Check This Out" Podcast in all podcast feeds starting in July of 2025.
