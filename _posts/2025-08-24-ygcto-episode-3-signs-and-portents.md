### A Secret Pilot?

Since we gave ourselves a second chance at a pilot, why not B5? Dre and I discovered along with our guest Carin Slater that you can safely start the series here and miss almost nothing from the larger plot. This is the one where we really start talking inner-species politics on the station. We get our first tense council meeting and subsequent vote.

We also get introduced to the series villains in the shadows this episode. All in all, coming into the series here is not a bad way to skim a few hours off the top. After all, when asked "What do you want", I always answer "More Time". Ironically, it's to watch more B5 so that's kinda self-defeating.

### Guest Episodes Begin

After establishing the podcast on our own, we've started booking guests. As of now, we should be able to have a guest booked on every episode of the B5 season. I'm sure a couple will fall through, but having that guest for the last few recordings has really shown us what we want to do with the podcast.

Having a guest gives us an audience surrogate to bounce ideas off. It also proved pretty quick that we really don't need a discussion topic. As long as we know our guests' interests, a quick interview at the top of the episode has given us enough content to break off into minisodes.

### This Week's Guest

Carin Slater is with us this week from the "Geek Out! with Megan and Carin" podcast. Carin is an email. marketing professional in a good way.  She helps companies to stop bothering people with unwanted spam. And make the emails that do get through smaller and more effective. She and Megan talk a little email on each show, but mostly dive into their nerdy interests. Come to think of it, Geek Out! is a much better sister show to Nerd! than YGCTO! will ever be.

### Babylon 5 Season 1 Episode 13: Signs & Portents

This series started its groove as soon as the non-aligned fish representative appeared in Deathwalker. This time, we see the main antagonist of the series. It's a fairly simple episode to establish each race's initial relationship to the Shadows. Fitting that the remainder of the B5 series will revolve around each race's positioning relative to the Shadows.

Londo being the special boy gets the prize egg. Also, his response to "What Do You Want?" was the most violent.
