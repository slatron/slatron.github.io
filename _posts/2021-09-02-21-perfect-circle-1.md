### Double Tracked Pianos

For my next experiment, let's see how playing this part on an electric and real piano and putting them together sounds.

Panning the same piano part between two hard sides is a nice sound. Just keeping that on the  outskirts and the vocals down the middle gives them each their own space nicely.

One more real piano part here. I got to go mic up my friends' piano for this one. At least for the piano on the left. The right one is my Yamaha s80 an octave lower on the individual notes.
