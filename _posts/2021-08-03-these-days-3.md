### Final Mix

After spending a good deal of time on the bass and drums, I was able to concentrate on the big guitar sound Peter gets here. I didn't come close - but did what I could without spending weeks fine-tuning the tone and layers. This would be a fun one to revisit if I get a few guitar amps with better recording gear down the line.

This is back to large numbers of layered tracks.
