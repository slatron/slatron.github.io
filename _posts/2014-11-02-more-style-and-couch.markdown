I upkeeped a couple of layout styles this weekend. Now crosstronica has a drawer UI. The pattern grid will be in the main area of the page. The user will be able to open and close the drawer to give the grid more room. I'll eventually set up a panel directive to contain each control type. That way, they will also be able to be opened, closed and dragged around as the user chooses. Dragon drop is awesome.

I also got back into a tiny bit of jekyll. A tiny but because I set up default pagination by copying and pasting the logic from [the main jekyll site][jekyll-site] into index.html.

I also set up couchdb on my other laptop so that I can update the app on either machine. I also have a first goal to use crosstronica for. I need to draw three small patterns for a Christmas gift. This should be a perfect test. First, I have to set up a way to save grid patterns to the database.
