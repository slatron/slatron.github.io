### To The Classics
I enjoy covering songs that are this led by the bass. This makes REM a great choice for me to do this with. If I can start songs like this with a solid bass part, I have a lot more room to play around with everything else.

Guitars have been rough to put togheter here. I'm really unsure of buth the sounds and how many guitars are playing at any time. Again, I get a lot of room from the bass part.
