### Band Break

The band took a break over the summer. We started rehearsing again last month and are working toward a three person show again. I used the time to also take a break and focus on work / family for awhile.

In the meantime, I did a few recording projects to keep up. I'll be posting these over the next week.

### Matchstick men

I was flirting with adding this to the band songs earlier this year before we knew Nate was leaving and thought we'd be adding a drummer. We won't be doing this anytime soon unless we re-arrange it.

This was still fun to record the fiddle and drum parts. I didn't get to play the kit on the REM songs, so this was a good way to get some drums in.

Nothings polished here as I did a quick take for each part and left it. We'll see if this gets revisited for a folkier arrangement.
