### Favorite Song

Getting to my favorite REM song at the last five songs drives home that this is the final streach. I've always wondered how those vocals fit together so well on this one. Time to figure it out.

One of the things I've noticed on this one is the many guitar sounds on each section of the song. The reverb and chorus on the chorus / intro sound completely different from the verse effects. It'll be a challenge to get them all sounding decent with the kids 3/4 scale fender. Especially with the song tuned down a half step on the album - which I'm also attempting.

One of my goals with this one is to bring out the bass more. The bart is incredibly difficult to play. It should be heard more than the mix on the album without overwhelming the song.
