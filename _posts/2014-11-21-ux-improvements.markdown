With Christmas approaching, I had to put my database quest on pause to start working on some gifts. I'm using Crosstronica in its alpha state to design all three of them, as well as some pieces for a future project. This way, I can also test the UX on myself to determine if the application is usable.

I'm creating three new pieces for the guys in my band. Each one is based on Carin's illustrator Mad Bread logo with all of our instruments as cartoon vector images. It should be easier to draw them in Crosstronica than manually with Photoshop, even at this early stage.

I still haven't nailed down the database solution. I'm still using couch for the pallete and hardcoded pattern objects to store the patterns. This works perfectly for my current needs, but will have to change if I want this avialable on a website. I've begun looking at express and have a version of Crosstronica working locally as an express project.

In the meantime, I'm using my current project to see if Crosstronica can be used as is to create easy patterns. In my next post, I'll describe some of the features I improved while using Crosstronica.
