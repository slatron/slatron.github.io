I've never been good at keeping up with blog entries. Part of that is because I always try and start one with no purpose other than journaling. That's never enough to keep me focused on writing.

My wife Carin recently started a [book blog][book-nook]. Shes had similar problems with writing posts on a new blog. But this one is going well for her. This is inspiring me to get my own started, but to get a subject to write about first that I can keep up with.

One problem is that I have too many interests. I'm a web developer, a musician, a husband and a father. I play board and video games when I can. I listen to several podcasts and sew cross-stitch.

My new strategy will be to focus this blog on a combination of two of those interests to keep myself from becoming bored of one subject. This will also help to see how two seemingly unrelated subjects can inspire each other.

Lookig at my interests, the most unique one is cross-stitching. Since I'm also in the middle of learning angular, I have a lot to explore. So, this blog will be about the development of a new application to help me create, edit and organize cross-stitching patterns. I can also include a gallery on the blog of patterns I've created and finished pieces.

The app will solve a problem that I have with keeping track of my patterns. I like to look at existing patterns and use them to create my own designs. This is very similar to looking at application code for design patterns. With a blog for creating a cross-stitch application, I'll be able to talk about these similarities while exploring them with code creation. At the end, I'll have a demo application that I plan to use in my hobby.

The high-level requirements for this application:

- Create new cross-stitch patterns
- Edit them through a web interface
- Save patterns
- View patterns for printing
- Store standard symbol / colors

I'll start defining some data requirements next time.

Cheers!
