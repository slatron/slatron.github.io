### Near Raw Heaven Take
I'm keeping up with recording a solo + instrument one take version to close each song. [Here is the one for Near Wild Heaven](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PGiQy88s7c2sMa8d9xxQpSGI6F-B1Fcd/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}. I'm follwing some rules on these.

- I only get one single take
- Any instrument should be played live with vocal
- No edits, overdubs or cuts
- Effects on master track only
  - only default patches

I need to figure out exactly why I'm recording these. I like hearing what these songs sound like completely stripped down. Its good for self-reflection. If nothing else, they don't take much time to record.
