### Everyone Needs A Little Tremelo
Even without being able to geet the tone right, a little tremelo helped the pre-chorus guitar. I'm thinking of sneaking a bit of tremelo in every song in honor of monster.

### Final Tracks (25)
Vocals (6)
- Main vocal (2)
- Backing Vocal (2)
- Tertiary Vocal (2)

Guitar (15)
- Bridge Growler (2)
- Intro (3)
- Rhythm (5)
- TREMELO!!
- Low Phaser Tone for Pre-Chorus muted (2)
- Extra Jangle Control (2)

Other (4)
- Full Kit
- Reverb Snare
- Bass (2)

### Faithful Cover?
It would be an impossible task to completely recreate this beautiful mess.

### Learnings
- More time goes a long way into getting the mixes and guitar tones right
- A good vocal performance beats a closely matched one

### Next Up
Exhuming McCarthy
