OK, now that I'm progressing with Angular at a daily rate, it's time to start a blog. I've used Jekyll before - plus it's free with my github account - so I'll be continuing with it.

Since I'm the only one going here for now, here's the Jekyll docs from the initial setup:

[jekyll]:      http://jekyllrb.com
[jekyll-gh]:   https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll
[jekyll-help]: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help
