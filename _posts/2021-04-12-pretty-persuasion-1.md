### Rawrangement

This one is almost intimidating from the simple arrangment. Drums + Bass. 2 Guitar Tracks. Vocals. Nothing else. I'll be practicing the parts and slowly recording through.

Vocals and guitar are both obscured in reverb here. Backing vocals are near inmpossible to discern here, sot that will be fun to mumble through. I have much going in right now and will be releasing these slower, but I'm still moving forward.
