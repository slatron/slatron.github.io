### Rawrangement

This one is almost intimidating from the simple arrangment. Drums + Bass. 2 Guitar Tracks. Vocals. Nothing else. I'll be practicing the parts and slowly recording through.

Vocals and guitar are both obscured in reverb here. Backing vocals are near impossible to discern here, so that will be fun to mumble through. I have to take a break from recording every night, but I'll still be able to get these out when ready.
