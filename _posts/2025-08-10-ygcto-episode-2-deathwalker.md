### Another Pilot?

You never get a second chance at a first impression... unless you give it to yourself. Which we kinda did here. The pilot episode we released on "Infection" was intended to be a recording test. Dre had enough confidence in it to release it as the pilot. Listening back, it's like a lot of first podcasts... rambling and unfocused.

Some of the best feedback I got was around structure and segments. As in more please. The best way to enforce structure now is via editing. So I'm taking a couple ideas into the next round of episodes. I also think I'll quit looking at any internet comments / feedback on this endeavor for the rest of time. I'll take a lightly positive constructive comment and go off into the sunset. Ahh... the benefits of not giving a F about monetization.

##### The first and last piece of internet feedback I'll ever read:

```
Great first pod guys.

If I can recommend some GU style reoccurring sections or
chapters to each episode, just to provide some structure.
Maybe a DS9 comparison on something from the B5 episode.,
like who did it better.

Also maybe tweak the logo. Just constructive suggestions,
nothing but love
```

Well said on the logo. I stripped out the green highlights and will be hiring a graphic artist at some point before season 2.

### New Release Plan

We're still recording every other week, but have noticed that we have enough material for two episodes each time. We also figured out that having guests on the show is an easy way to both generate an interesting topic and enforce structure.

Instead of our initial bi-weekly release plan, we're going to release a minisode every other week. The minisode will feature a topic discussion cut from the main episode. This will keep the main episodes focused on B5 material while allowing us to release some shorter side topics.

I'll aim for 1 hour main episodes. Minisodes will vary from a few minutes to a half-hour. I'll add a spoken intro and outro to frame the discussion and remind the listener what B5 episode to watch next. It's more work in editing, but I think it will give the show a better flow.

### This Week's Guest

Still just me & Dre for our first couple go-rouds. Next time, we start the guests.

### Babylon 5 Season 1 Episode 9: Deathwalker

Another monster of the week episode here. We get JMS working through thoughts on revenge, human nature and genocide. As individuals, we make good decisions based on our personal experience. As a collective, we make horrible moral decisions. I blame it on the tragedy of the commons writ large.

Cat Lady knows the better nature of a race will have them killing each other to enrich their own lives. I disagree on a personal level, but agree that eventually someone will argue why we need to take lives of one group to extend another. It will be possible through generations of propaganda and history erosion. That's not something a single person can put into motion. But Cat Lady sets up the environment for that to take hold.

More importantly, she gets absolutely rocked by a full body sucka punch in the first scene.

### Mike's Image Picks

Inspiration for the sucka punch variation: The Sucka Lunge!

For a telepath, Talia sure gets suckered into a lot of Mind Mazes.
