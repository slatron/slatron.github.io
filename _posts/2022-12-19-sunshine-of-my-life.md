### Wedding Song

This was the first song that Carin and I danced to at our wedding.  Naturally she picked it first for me to cover.

The changes here are very complex compared to most pop tunes. Instead of using the original instrumentation, I pared it back to drums bass and vibes. That meant writing a new drum part since the original is all congas and auxuillary percussion. I also eschewed the backing vocal choir and horn section to keep it simple.

The best part of this project so far was getting to dance with my wife again to this. I also had a mild case of Covid while recording the vocals, just to see if I could still do it.

I did cheat on the key change in the vibes by transposing B to C for the first two choruses and verses. I'm only one person after all.
