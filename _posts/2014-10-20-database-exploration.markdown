I haven't added anything in a few days. Carin and I got to go on a short vacation to Geneva, IL. Mom and Dad came into town with GG to watch Zoey for the night. It was great to get away for a bit and recharge.

I'm now trying to figure out the persistant storage issue. I'm not much of a database guy. I have some experience with MySQL + PHP, but only enough to set some basic CMS's by with Codeigniter. Since I only need basic json files to run crosstronica, I'm looking at no-sql options. Mongo seems a bit much for what I need, so I'll try and set up Couch DB next. I'll report back when I have more.
