#### UW Draw-Go Modern

I'm new to modern, but have been playing MTG casually for 23 years. My favorite builds were always homebrewed UW control, so I'm starting there with my modern deck.

I was playing with the current popular WU Tapout Control modern shell. It might be better fit to beat the current meta, but I miss my draw-go style of UW control. So I'm forging ahead alone in search of a draw-go UW Control that works for me.

Four Snapcasters support this style of control and form the foundation of my deck philosophy. At four Snaps, I feel like each instant or sorcery represents 1.25 slots. So instead of 4 Paths, the deck plays as if it had five. Nice easy way to set deck philosophy in terms of math. My list follows the typical modern Tapout UW Control shell closely. The big problem is cutting enough permanents to play more draw-go without destroying my game against the usual field.

I cut the typical walls and seas to focus more on instants than permanents. Those were always the cards that didn't excite me during games. I never felt like those were winning me games, just stalling Evil at best.

The land base is pretty solid at 25. I play two Hallowed Fountains, but might go down to one when I get two more Field of Ruin. This deck wants to keep it's land count up and field helps to stay at parity. It also plays well into draw-go giving another option on Evils end step. So to make up slightly for the Seas, this will eventually play four Fields and one Ghost Quarter.

The single Azcanta can be great early to smooth lands and setup snapcaster targets. It was the only permanent I added to the maindeck. The detention spheres have proven too useful as a catchall for anything that slips through the counters. The ability to sphere enchantments like Blood Moon or Chalice on 1 or 2 has proven this card's worth. Not to mention Liliana containment.

Those early cuts freed up 5 slots from the common shell (-2 Walls, -4 Seas, +1 Azcanta). One slot went to the fourth snapcaster. I'm using a wide variety of counterspells to hit every occasion. Beefing a 2/2 Leak/Negate counter-suite up with 2 Logic Knots and Spell Snare feels correct.

The last extra slot went to a single Opt. I am constantly wanting to cut a Serum Visions or two in favor of Opt for the sweet delicious one mana left open on Evils turn. Plus, snappy needs cheap instants paired with surprise blocks. Fortunately I know better than that. Opt may be better for a pure draw-go to leave mana open for options. But Serum gets the full four as those two scrys are perfect for setting up plans.

Win-cons are the 3 Gideons, single Jace and 4 Colonades. The planeswalker plan can be risky in a draw-go strategy, but their power level is usually enough to justify letting shields down. Knowing what haste is in Evils deck is key after cutting the Walls. Reality smashers are Gideon party killers. I'm strongly considering a maindeck Blessed Alliance for this reason.

More cuts I am considering:

1 Supreme Verdict -> 1 Settle the Wreckage:Verdict is the best answer to a board of creatures, but I would still like to lean further into avoiding tapping out on my turn. Settle the Wreckage is good for surprise value and keeping mana open. Bad since its easy to play around if opponent knows I have it. I have one in the sideboard but am close to ditching this idea as there are several drawbacks to Settle that outweigh the potential to leave mana open.

Jace to Sideboard -> Blessed Alliance:Jace is great against wide creature decks and can generate steady card advantage with -2, but may not be the best option to risk lowering defenses before turn 6. I replaced the fourth Gideon in the sideboard as its more clear when to bring in the Jace.

1 Mana Leak -> Remand:Im tough on Paths negative synergy with the Leaks, but Ive also rarely been in a situation where a leak in hand is a dead card. Even in Tron matchups (??!?!). I havent puled the trigger on this as the remand could backfire in a similar way. Like when opponent can just double-cast the Karn on the same turn with tron mana. But at least Id get a card out of the exchange.
