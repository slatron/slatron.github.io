### Mad Bread Solo

Steve asked me to play a solo from one of my band's songs this time. I played through this one for Sad Beautiful. It's one that usually features Carl on acoustic for the two guitar breaks. It was one of his signatures at shows.

I'm using D major in G through D positions to follow the melody line. I thow in a couple of minor shifts for the blues bends at somne phrases. Most of what I do is following carl's lead from the original.
