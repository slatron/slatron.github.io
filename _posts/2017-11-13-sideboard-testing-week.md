#### My Story

A month after committing to UW in modern, I'm in the last stretch before my first actual local modern night. My first post was about general first thoughts on the archetype. This time, I'll talk more about how I got back in.

#### Zoey's Influence

My daughter Zoey stared reading at a high level out of nowhere. Since she was two, my wife Carin and I have been playing board games with her. She has been able to play some pretty serious games beyond her supposed age level. Settlers of Catan, 7 Wonders Duel, King of Tokyo, Roll for the Galaxy, Agricola, Ticket to Ride, Lords of Waterdeep, Galaxy Trucker and Quadropolis are just a few of the games she has enjoyed with us.

The whole time, I told her she had to wait for Magic until she could prove she could read well. With the Ixalan release, I bit the bullet and ordered a variety pack from coolstuffinc. The first time I've purchased any MTG product since Theros.

It's been going very well. Zoey is almost seven and grasps the mechanics of the game, she just has some time to go on sequencing spells and tactics. No matter, I play easy on her or with sub-par decks and we still have a great time. Carin will do no such thing and doesn't hold back nearly as much. It's good because I get to encourage her to play for fun above all while Mommy is the person to beat to prove herself.

#### Meanwhile, in the lab...

That's all good for family time, but it truly relit my passion for the game on a competitive level. I have always relegated myself to a kitchen table casual player. And it's worked out great for me so far. Carin and I ran a kitchen table group that would meet once a week for five years. From Zendikar through Dragon's Maze, we met once a week. Even after Zoey was born, we still got games in until several members of the group moved away.

It was fun being the guy to beat in my playgroup, but I never really got to test my skill at the game in a real format. So now after the kids go to bed, I get to brewing and testing.

I made the point of no return for choosing modern and solidifying it by purchasing a playset of Celestial Colonades. I always had one from Worldwake, but would need a full playset. One large purchase for three pieces of cardboard later, I was fully committed to building a UW or UWx control deck.

I started going to the local store more often, [Evaston Games & Cafe](https://www.evanstongames.com/) and trading for the missing pieces. At the Ixalan Prerelease, I played against a few graduate students that go to Northwestern and live nearby. They came over for a casual EDH afternoon, but we ended up talking modern. So, I started proxying up several Tier 1 and 2 decks for testing nights. The guys I'm testing with have already become friends that I look forward to hanging out with - regardless if we're spell-slinging or not.

#### This Week

So now I'm looking at 5 more nights before my first modern night at the store. I fully plan on getting my ass handed to me over several rounds. And that's OK. I feel like I've won already just by getting back into the game. Moreso because the game is serving several roles in my life: Family time, social activity, mental challenges and self-improvement.

I see magic not as a way to win and conquer lesser mages, but as a way to continually grow as a player and as a person. Also as a way to meet other players. As a control mage coming into an unknown meta I will be at a severe disadvantage. But as long as I learn something from every game, I'll be happy with my performance.

For this week, I need to finish sideboarding plans for at least four tier 1 decks. Those will begin appearing at the [sideboarding](/sideboarding) page on this site. Next time, I'll talk about some decklist changes I've made based on testing.
