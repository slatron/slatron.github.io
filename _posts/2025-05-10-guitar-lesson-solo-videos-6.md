### Next Steely Dan Solo

Steve assigned me the name songs from Aja as my first two guitar solos to learn. One of my goals with lessons was to learn as many Dan songs as I could handle. I wsan't expecting to tackle Peg so soon. Its known as one of their most difficult solos to nail.

Boy did I not nail this one. I got the parts seprately, but was still never able to play the sextuplet run up to tempo cleanly. After a month of working on it on and off, I recorded two versions so I can move on to a Skunk solo.

- I biffed the beginning, but stabilized for the rest

- I hit n' miss the phrases, but overall passed the solo

Good news is that I learn a lot from learning solos even if I can't nail them. [Jay Graydon has a video on Tim Pierce's channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ghp88V3Qm8w) where he goes over most of the techniques. He didn't go into detail on the sextuplets, but rhythm latters were a huge help in figuring out the RH picking. "tah - - tah key -" for the rhythm nerds out there.

My next entries on this blog will be much more Babylon 5 focused. I've been taking extensive notes on each episode and need to turn thim into some sort of content.
