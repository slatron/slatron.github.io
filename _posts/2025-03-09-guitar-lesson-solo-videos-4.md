### Starting Dan

Playing Steely Dan on guitar is one of my main goals for huitar lessons. I recently got a book with most of their famous guitar songs tabbed. Josie seemed like a good intro to both the chords and a manageable solo.

I really enjoyed getting the syncopation on this one. Walter Becker played it on the album, Its understated and off-axis in a wobbly way. Including a blusey shift at the end.

I'm not sure if he played the double-bends in the pre-solo, but those were a great challenge. One string is up 1/2 and the other is a full bend.

These are videos I'm recording for my guitar lessons to see my own progress. Your enjoyment level may vary.
