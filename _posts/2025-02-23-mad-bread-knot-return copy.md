### Back at the Knot

It was a night of firsts. Andy's first time playing out  with us. Teds first show. My first time on guitar. The new Knot is about half the size. We played in a small front area that echoed like a box. The crowd was great to us and we had a good time.

I'm giving it some time before listening to the recordings. Steve told me to find something that I did from each song that surprised myself. I know I hit a few good points, so hopefully I'll be able to listen without being too self-critical.
