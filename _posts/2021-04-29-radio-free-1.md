### To The Classics
I have to believe that this song is key to many REM fans like me that were too young to see them live in the early days. We got everything from the albums. "Radio Free Europe" is the opener on two of them for a reason.

This and "Driver 8" from Eponymous were responsible for my learning how to play guitar. Early on, REM was already the carrot to learning.

I'll be going with the album version as the leader track for this one. As fun as the Hib-Tone one would be, this one is better suited for my setup.
