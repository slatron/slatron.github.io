### Home Studio

We got through the last month and ended up in a great new place. Along with that comes a room I can use for a studio.

It took around a month to get relatively settled. At least enough to where I can spend some time on music.

Best part is that I can keep my keyboard set up in the space. My Yamaha s80 is now always sitting right there. I'm recording it right fron the 1/4" output. This also lets me play along in the room to the track - using only the laptop speakers. No headphones makes it feel like I'm playing with a band as opposed to in my head.

Professor is an excellent first one for piano. The chords are so simple, making the in-room recording easy to feel through.
