#### Newest list after sideboard decisions

Looking at my sideboarding decisions, <span showcard>Spreading Seas</span> was coming in for all the tier 1 decks. I'm trying something new, but that coupled with everyone with advice on the internet says to run it made me <span showcard>Think Twice</span>. In fact, I cut my second <span showcard>Think Twice</span> for a Seas. That and a <span showcard>Negate</span>.

I also took some advice and put <span showcard="Jace, Architect of Thought">Jace</span> back in the main board. The single <span showcard="Ancestral Vision">Vision</span> was cut to make room. I now have 4 Seas in my 75. Starting 2 in the main and bringing in the full set for some matchups.

My sideboard was changing too much. So rather than trying to figure out everything, I stepped back and put in more copies of less cards. I may not be prepared for enough situations, but this should help me determine when to use these specific tools.

The deck is ready. I should be at my first modern night tomorrow. I hope I can be in the mindset for a good tournament report.
