### Garage Band Arrangement
As far as the arrangement, this is the simplest one of the poject so far. Guitar, Bass and Drums for a tight trio. Vocals on top, no more. Sure, there are a couple double-tracked guitar parts - but overall this is a basic garage band arrangement.

It was immediately a different challenge from the previous songs. I wouldn't have to play with synths or software instruments to re-create the song. Not even a midi piano track. This one is all about getting the right guitar sound. Vovals on the orignal mixes are so buried that guitar tone took a lead role here. Except for the usual hidden hero.

### Silent Hero
I'm so surprised that I never heard the excellent bass part here. It carries the entire song, right out in the open. Mike had so many fills in this one that make the song but get lost in the guitar on this one. It was such a pleasure to learn.

### Wuh-Wuh-Wuh-Wuh-Wuh-Wuh-Wuh-Wuh
Peter's guitar tone on the original song sounds so mid EQ's. Like a narrow radio band. I ended up playing the rhythm part twice. That's the main rhythm track, panned out across the two takes. I copied one of the takes and reduced it to an extreme narrow-band EQ on top of the others - right down the middle. I couldn't get mine like the original, but I ended up on something I like.
