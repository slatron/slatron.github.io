### The Sounds of Murmur
While listening to "Shaking Through" several times, its amazing how much of the music sounds like a massive wave. Like a wash of sounds all combining together. Maybe its mostly this song, but the backing guitars and piano feel soaked in reverg on this.

Peter's guitar style was full on open string arpeggiation. Both this and "Near Wild Heaven" had really unique picking patterns between fretted and open strings up and down the neck.

All of Michael's vocals are practically buried in the mix at points. I'll see how close I can get during mixing. Maybe getting agressive on EQ space for a specific vocal band on everything else, then pulling the vocals back in volume. Would probably help for the final shouty chorus
