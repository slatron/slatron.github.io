### Final Mix

While this version begain around a Peter inspired jangly riff, it quickly morphed into somehing that would have been more home on ATS or Reveal. I missed the "Murmur version of Leave" by a ton. But I still enjoy this different, speedy but still moody version of the song. Its very reminiscent of the alternate Leave versinon from "A Life Less Ordinary". Both thave the sustained high B and E string parts. My guess is that riff was similarly constructed to the one I'm using here.

### Faithful Cover?
No, but that was the goal here. While it sounds nothing like what I entended, I'm still enjoying the final result as an alternate universe Leave.

### Learnings
- Do not be afraid to get creative here, but finishing the project at this point is the main goal
