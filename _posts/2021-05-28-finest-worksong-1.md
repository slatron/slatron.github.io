### Industrial Music

Minstry aside, now this is what I call industrial music 8 )>. The boys made the term literal in this one. A call to action for workers. I'll need to get asn anvil hit in there for versimilitude.

My horn patches are pretty weak, but I think I can handle this one without them.

I'm really looking forward to this one. It seems very simple from the offset compared to some of my recent covers like "Leave" and "Exhuming McCarthy".
