The more I play around with couch, the less I like it. This could be simply because databases and operations aren't my best skill. But I also can't find much beyond the main Apache documentation on couch. Everything seems to be pointing to MEAN with mongo db as a full stack solution for this kind of app.

Most importantly, I get a lot of unsolicited emails from technical recruiters. Most of them include MEAN on the list of technical requirements (or at least nice to haves). There's a lot more out there in the internets on MEAN, which tells me that there will be more community support once I get to deployment.

I'm going to be taking yet another side trip. I think it will still be worth it as I'm not really on a timeline to get Crosstronica launched. I'd still like to be able to use it for a few Christmas gift patterns, but there's nothing stopping me from using good old fashioned pencil and paper for those small pieces. Plus, the holidays are going to be a natural sidetrack for me anyway. Actually, I can use Crosstronica in a poor man's manner by creating the patterns I want and saving screenshots of them. The pieces I'm thinking of are small enough where that will be viable.
