#### First Time Out

I had a blast tonight at Evanston Games. The store is four blocks from home. I've been taking Zoey there on weekends to participate in Ixalan League. After deeming them "not assholes", I decided to restart this whole Magic thing.

There were 16 players for modern. Mostly experienced but friendly players. Despite how inviting everyone was, they were still serious about playing. It's exactly what I'm looking for.

I didn't see any straight decks from the current tier 1 and 2 lists. So many cards I've never seen. So many mistakes.

#### Lessons

The two primary improvements in my game should be:

##### Keep better track of the graveyard state
##### Understand opponent lines of play with strip mine effects

There were many other smaller lessons
- Settle the Wreckage is great in control mirrors
- Diversify my sideboard options
- Local modern meta is extremely wide open
- Know what colors you are tapping
- Tap slow as not to miss what you tapped / tapped fetch for mana
- Double-check deck count with pile shuffle after sideboarding

After losing my first game to Jeskai Delver, I boarded in the wrong half of my sideboard. I noticed that my count was off, but played anyway. 0-1.

Second game was vs esper control. Lost that in two close games.

My one win was in the third round against a high school kid trying to make a boros herioc combo deck work. He went to King Arts like Zoey. Nice to hear that he liked the school.

Last game was vs UW Control Seance. I was definitely outplayed. First game took most of the match time. I lost. Second game went to time. Fortunately, I could have won both games if not for errors, so I know what to look out for in the future.

I won't get to play again for at least three weeks. We're in Michigan for Thanksgiving. Then Zoey's birthday that next weekend.
