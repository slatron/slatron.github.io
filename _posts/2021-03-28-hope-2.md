### Bleepin and Bloopin
Glad I picked up that freee Podalski synth for this one. I had to dial in seveal sounds for this one - none of them sound like the original, but I think I got something for every part of the arrangement.

I knew that this one would be a challenge to sing, but I had no idea it would have phrases longer than "I Believe". Michael doesn't take a breath for very long streaches of this song, sometimes merging the end of one verse with the next. Plus the lyrics of this on e always hit me hard. Many vocal takes were ruined via sobbing.

This turned out to be a good excercise in the synths. I don't think this will be up there with my favorite covers, but it's forcing me to lerasn a lot about craftin synth sounds. Probably because I'm doing this and another song atonce away from my home studio. Another good test run for making these.
