#### Better Ideas

I'm still figuring out the best 75 in a UW Draw-Go deck for me. I'm not looking to solve the meta with this deck, just shooting to give myself the best chances that this style deck can have against the unknown.

I've settled on a few choices mentioned at the end of my first post. I cut the Jace to make room for more instant speed effects. Opt is completely gone from my list as it never was good to cast. Serum Visions is so much stronger a play even on my turn. Field of Ruin has proven to be a great card I'll sacrifice the speed of Ghost Quarter to get the mana fixing of Field.

Settle the Wreckage is only good in the sideboard against a few key matchups like Robots. I'll be leaving it out for now until I know what to expect locally. Plus the Stony Sliences do a better job of keeping that deck down. The single copy of Azcanta is great. It generally gets more cards than the Jace did. I'm also liking the single Ancestral Recall. If I pick up one more copy, I'll likely go up to two and go down to three Serum Visions.

I'm down to one Detention Sphere, but keeping the second in the board for Liliana and Blood Moon expectations. If there proves to be a lot of that in the meta, I'll likely swap the sideboard Sphere out for a Celestial Purge.

I'm still considering taking out Gideon Jura for a Secure the Wastes. Though I want to see how Gideon performs at an actual tournament first. I'm also ready to go back to a Seas build if this whole draw-go thing blow up in my face.
