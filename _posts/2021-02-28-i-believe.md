### I'm A Belieber
So looks like I have a change to make good on some mistakes in Shaking Through. We'll see what I have for the accordian. Times like these when I wish I still had an accordian. The organ selectino here on Garageband is solid, so we'll likely be using that instead.

Instead of layering the electric, let's stick to one jangle track and one acoustic. Acoustic guitar comes out better so far than my electrric guitar pages. I'll try to get a more dialed in jangle tone on the one track arpeggiating the top chord tones. Acoustic for the lower accents and full chords. This will work like the guitar/piano panning from "Shaking Through", but with acoustic guitar instead of the piano. I may end up adding a lower electric overdub for the lower E to F notes that start the main guitar riff.

Backing vocals were kind of a mess on "Shaking Through". I'll have to leave more time for them at the end to match against the main vocals.
