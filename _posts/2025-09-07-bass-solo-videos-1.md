### Back to Bassics

Betcha thought I was done with the music posts 8 )>

Since I'm playing a gig on fretless bass today, I've been trying to practice my lines in different ways. For "Diamonds on the Soles of her Shoes", I attempted to sing the lead while playingg the bass part against a 110bpm drum track.

It's a great self-challenge to layer on another level once you have a bapart down. For this one, I was looking for two things

1) Keep the groove moving while singing

2) Nail the upper register fills

3) Start thumbing through the strings on the thumb/pop section

I'm still struggling with #3 with and without the vocals. I'm so used to bouncing off the strings with I slap. But I can get a good sound by going through the strings while not wrecking the fretboard yhis way.

#1-3 varied in quality with singing. I drift off so much when focusing on the vocalsd. But I'm at a point where I can nail the feel and fills when not focusing on singing.

It feel so good to play fretless again.
