### Cuttin the Topic

Our first batch of episodes almost all had a prepared topic beyond the episode covered. For "Deathwalker" we had planned to talk about JMS' background right before the show started. With the new minisode plan, you get that talk as its own cast.

##### The first and last piece of internet feedback I'll ever read:

This one comes from YouTube...

```
I have to assume YouTube isn't your main platform,
but I found the previous episode randomly and subscribed
However, unless you include the Babylon 5 name in the
title, you're going to rely on random chance for people
to find it, which I suspect is not what you want.
```

You're right... we're not trying to monetize or rely on random people finding it. I've always had this odd relationship to creating. I love doing it for the sake of doing it... and doing it on a schedule to the top of my reasonable ability.

Finding Dre was really the key that made me want to do this. I could have started a solo cast at any time... but that's not what I want to do. I'm more interested in keeping this going for a few seasons and finding out what it becomes.

Yes, we'd gather more listeners if we advertised this as a B5 podcast... but that would be a pretty big bait and switch when the series starts talking about comics or music. I want to get 100 episodes in with a few seasons under our belts before I even begin to define.

### What Did We Learn?
