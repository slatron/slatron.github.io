### Back on Track

After a month off, I'm back to finish the last leg of the project before 2021 rolls out. Four more to go after this one.

### Final Mix

Unexpectedly, the number of guitar tracks beat out the vocal tracks here. It took eight tracks to get all four parts with doubles. There are eight distinct guitar parts here. I only doubled one for the chorus / intro sections.

Bass did come out more. But with those bouncing eighth octaves, it's difficult to control.

### Final Tracks (21)
- Vocals (8)
- Guitar (9)
- Bass
- Drums (2)
- Harmonica

### Learnings

This song is perfect for my vocal range. Gotta remember this one.
