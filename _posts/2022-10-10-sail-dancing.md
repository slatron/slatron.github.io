### Live Mashup

This one came after thinking about how to mashup songs in a live folk performance. I really enjoy Neil Ciccergia's mashups. He always gets something more by what he juxtaposes together.

If that can be done with samples, it could also be done live. The idea is to play one song and karaoke the lyrics of a different one over the top. You can also go in and out of both songs at any point - or layer them on top of each other

This was an attempt to write an arrangement of Orinoco FLow and Dance Hall Days as a folk mashup. Just a quick demo for fun.
