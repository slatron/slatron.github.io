### Shhhh... Don't Tell Dre the Nerdkiller's Alive 

Just between you and me, Dre’s not here. He kept ranting about some emergency and would only use the phrase “Quality Insurance” to explain where he was going. Last I saw he was disappearing over the horizon in a wicker basket attached to the talons of some kinda giant green sky mongoose. I got a text yesterday saying he’s never been more at peace with the universe and he'll be back in a couple weeks.

Not to worry, knowing ourselves we baked an insanity clause into both our podcast schedules and have enough episodes banked to keep releasing while Dre is away. In the meantime, I have to get a minisode theme ready. I thought I’d take some time to share how I create these theme songs. Just promise me one thing. don’t tell Dre I‘m doing this. As long as Dre never finds out about this. We’re good.

Check out the episode as I take you through my process of recording parts for the short minisode theme you'll be occastionally hearing on the show.
