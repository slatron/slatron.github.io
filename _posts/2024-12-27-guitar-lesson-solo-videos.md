### Guitar Lessons

After playing more lead guitar this past year, I found a good teacher to work with. Steve Knight is a master student at DePaul. He lives on the north side in Edgewater. I've been going out there every otehr Saturday.

The lessons are covering technique, fretboard pattern mapping and listerning. I've been playing Arpeggios, cadences and scales just like I used to on piano. Having Colin as a student helps me to reinforce the concepts. I get to pass on the CAGED method while studying it.

Each lesson, I get assigned a solo to learn. First was Back in Black, then Hotel California. I'll see if I can remember to share them here each lesson.
