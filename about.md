My name is Mike Slater and I have been creating websites for the past 17 years. My focus has alwys been on frontend web deveopent.

I began with simple HTML table layouts and inline font attributes. Ever since discovering css, I've been hooked on client-side programming.  I learned enough PHP and SQL for basic server-side functionality, but felt more at home writing jQuery plugins than databases. At least early on.

For years I was content turning custom designed photoshop mocks into working websites. I couldn't design much from am blank page myself, but I got real good at writing cross-browser HTML, CSS and Javascript<sub>1</sub>.

Around the time Sass and Knockout came around, I began to feel less like a div-jockey and more like a real Web Developer. I was finally understaning why someone would need build control and pre-compilers. Github became just as part as my workflow as my text editor and terminal were. Oh yeah, and at some point I had come to rely on the terminal for everyting.

Which starts with a single gulp command to make this all happen for me as I simply write code.

Now that I have started using angular to build some small apps, I feel even more like a developer. Mostly because I have to think differently about how I structure my code. I always knew how to structure javascript code in many different ways, but I never knew when to use them. Because angular enforces dependency injection early on, I could finally make that connection. I feel like I can make better decisions about starting a project after just two months of using angular.

This blog exists to document the develpoment of a cross-stitch helper application written with angular. As I mentioned, I have only been using angular for two months as of this writing. I intend to log the progress of the app here and discuss how I feel about angular through the development process.

Cheers!
