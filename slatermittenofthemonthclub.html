  <h1 class="page-heading">Welcome to the Slater Bi-Monthly Mitten Club!</h1>

  <p>Congratulations, you are the proud recipiant of a series of one-of-a-kind WOMEN OF MARVEL FINGERLESS MITTENS! That's right, every other month in 2022 you will recieve a custom knitted mitten. Most of these will be based on the exquisite designs of Carin M Slater. All hand-knitted by her devoted husband.</p>

  <p>The fun starts in December 2021, where your first mitten should already be delivered to you. The rest of the series will come throughout the year, so you have a gift that keeps on giving.</p>

  <p>Mittens in summer? These are so unique, you'll want to make that fashion statement</p>
  
  <p>These mittens are unlined, but the first one comes with a series of skin-tight gloves in several colors to be mixed and matched as your mood and cold hands dictate. And they have those tip thingies that allow for phone usage even as your phalanges are shielded. Unsatisfied with any part of your gift. Too frackin' bad! you're getting it!</p>
