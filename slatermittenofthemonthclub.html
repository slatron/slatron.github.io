<h2>Mittens in summer?</h2>
  
<p>These are so unique, you'll want to make that fashion statement!</p>

<h2>Linings or Go Home</h2>

<p>These mittens are unlined, but the first one comes with a series of skin-tight gloves in several colors to be mixed and matched as your mood and cold hands dictate. And they have those tip thingies that allow for phone usage even as your phalanges are shielded.</p>

<h3>Unsatisfied with any part of your gift? Too frackin' bad! you're getting it!</h3>
